# CSC462 – Artificial Intelligence
## Lab 02 – Python Lists and Dictionaries

### 🎯 Objective
This lab introduces Python’s collection data types. We will gain hands-on experience with lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries, as well as learn to implement custom functions.

---

### 📚 Activity Outcomes
By completing this lab, students will:
- Understand indexing and slicing in sequences.  
- Use lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.  
- Apply loops to manipulate data structures.  
- Write customized Python functions.

### 📝 Pre-Lab Reading
- Chapters **6, 10, and 14** of *Introduction to Programming Using Python* (Y. Liang, Pearson, 2013).  

---

### 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Lists**: creation, indexing, slicing, comprehensions.  
- **Tuples**: immutable ordered collections.  
- **Sets**: unordered collections without duplicates.  
- **Dictionaries**: key-value pairs, insertion order.  
- Common methods: `.append()`, `.remove()`, `.pop()`, `.update()`, `.keys()`, `.values()`.  

---

### ✅ Solved Activities
- Joining lists.  
- Palindrome checker.  
- Matrix multiplication with 2D lists.  
- Polygon perimeter calculation using tuples.  
- Symmetric difference function for sets.  
- Phonebook dictionary with tuple keys.

### 🎓 Lab Tasks
1. Merge two lists and display sorted output.  
2. Find smallest and largest element in a list.  
3. Approximate derivative using lists and compare with `cos(x)`.  
4. Birthday dictionary lookup system.  
5. Extract specific keys from a dictionary into a new dictionary.
