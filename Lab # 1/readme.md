# CSC462 – Artificial Intelligence
## Lab 01 – Python Revision

### 🎯 Objective
This lab is an introductory session on Python. It equips students with the fundamental concepts required to build algorithms in Python.

---

### 📚 Activity Outcomes
By completing this lab, students will learn:
- Basic operations on strings and numbers.  
- Usage of conditionals (`if`, `else`, `elif`).  
- Implementation of loops (`for`, `while`).  
- Understanding of variables and data types.  

---

### 📝 Pre-Lab Reading
- Chapters **3–5** of *Introduction to Programming Using Python* (Y. Liang, Pearson, 2013).  

---

### 🔑 Key Concepts
- Python indentation as control structure.  
- Dynamic typing and variable assignments.  
- Data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans.  
- Basic input/output handling.  

---

### ✅ Solved Activities
- Checking even/odd numbers.  
- Summation of user inputs until a sentinel value.  
- Prime number check.  
- Summing 5 integers with a flowchart.  
- Greeting and user input handling.  
- While loop operations (sum from 0–10).  
- Random number guessing game.

### 🎓 Lab Tasks
1. Reverse digits of an integer (e.g., 12345 → 54321).  
2. Sum of even and odd integers from user input.  
3. Fibonacci series up to `n` terms.  
4. Grade calculation based on marks (A–F).  
5. Factorial calculation using loops.
